                    "answer": "The Q2000 microinverter has 4 independent inputs that are transformer isolated from the AC output and have their negative DC inputs referenced to ground thru the GFDI circuit. Considering the inverter handles each module individually, the calculations are below for the 64-200 (1):\n\n• the rated operating current and voltage; this is the module maximum power current (Imp) and module maximum power voltage (Vmp).\n\n• the maximum photovoltaic source circuit voltage; this is equal to the PV module’s open circuit voltage (Voc).\n\n• the rated short-circuit current; this is equal to the PV module’s short circuit current (Isc).\n\nThe Trunk cable used with the Q2000 connects the AC output of all inverters in parallel. This means the voltage on the trunk cable remains the same (240Vac) but the current from each inverter (7.5 Amps) gets added. A trunk with 3 inverters connected to it will have 2 x 7.5A = 22.5A under full power. Adding a 1.25 safety factor gives a design current of 22.5 x 1.25 = 28.125A."

                    "question": "My SparqLinq is joined to most inverters but some are distant and not connecting. What can I do?",
                    "answer": "Plug the SparqLinq into an extension cord and move it to different locations (possibly outside or up on the roof) and try joining to the inverter using the 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab. It is important that the inverter be first joined to the SparqLinq before it can start connecting to other inverters in a mesh network. Put the SparqLinq in a non-metallic weatherproof box on the roof to get it closer to the inverters. It may be necessary to use a second SparqLinq to connect the additional inverters. If the inverters have been joined to the first SparqLinq, you will need to go to its 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab and click on the 'X' in the Release column before the inverters can be joined to a new SparqLinq. Two or more SparqLinqs can be monitored on the SparqVu website, but there is no function to allow pairing the sites together."

                    "answer": "The status LED on the Q1200 will be flashing green when working correctly. If the LED is flashing Red, this indicates an AC issue so check the AC breaker. If the LED is amber, this indicates a ground fault was detected so check for faulty DC wiring then connect to the SparqLinq and go to the \"Settings->Inverter Management\" page and click the Clear GFDI (blue lightning bolt) icon."

                    "answer": "The data sheet suggests a maximum DC module rating of 350W, but the Q1200 is designed to work with 72 cell modules with STC ratings up to 390W or a 1.3 DC/AC ratio."

                    "question": "How do I calculate the maximum PV source and output circuit voltage of an installed system (this is to do with 64-200 (1)(b) of the CEC 2015 code)?",
                    "answer": "The Q1200 microinverter has 4 independent inputs that are transformer isolated from the AC output and have their negative DC inputs referenced to ground thru the GFDI circuit. Considering the inverter handles each module individually, the calculations are below for the 64-200 (1):\n\n• the rated operating current and voltage; this is the module maximum power current (Imp) and module maximum power voltage (Vmp).\n\n• the maximum photovoltaic source circuit voltage; this is equal to the PV module’s open circuit voltage (Voc).\n\n• the rated short-circuit current; this is equal to the PV module’s short circuit current (Isc).\n\nThe Trunk cable used with the Q1200 connects the AC output of all inverters in parallel. This means the voltage on the trunk cable remains the same (240Vac) but the current from each inverter (5 Amps) gets added. A trunk with 5 inverters connected to it will have 5 x 5A = 25A under full power. Adding a 1.25 safety factor gives a design current of 25 x 1.25 = 31.25A."

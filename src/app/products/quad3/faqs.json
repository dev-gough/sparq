            "id": 40,
            "question": "Can I use one Quad3 unit with a 5 hp or higher power solar water pump?",
            "answer": "Yes, but with limitations. A single Quad3 will still cap its output at 3 hp. While it can power the motor, it will not reach full speed or torque, and performance will be reduced."
        },
        {
            "id": 41,
            "question": "Can I use one Quad3 unit with a 2 hp or lower power solar water pump?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. The Quad3 uses smart, sensorless control to safely limit output based on motor parameters like frequency and voltage, ensuring safe operation and protecting the motor from damage."

            "question": "How can I tell if the Q2000 inverter is working?",
            "answer": "The status LED on the Q2000 will be flashing green when working correctly. If the LED is flashing Red, this indicates an AC issue so check the AC breaker. If the LED is amber, this indicates a ground fault was detected so check for faulty DC wiring then connect to the SparqLinq and go to the 'Settings->Inverter Management' page and click the Clear GFDI (blue lightning bolt) icon."

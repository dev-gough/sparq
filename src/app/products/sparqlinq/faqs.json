            "question": "The SparqLinq Dashboard page 'DAY DETAILS' reports 'No data for the selected day'.",
            "answer": "SparqLinq missing data may occur if the time and date was not restored correctly from an internet time server when the SparqLinq was last power cycled. This causes the data to be stored under the default date set in the SparqLinq, instead of under today’s date. To check this, go to the 'Settings->Installation Information' page. At the bottom of the tab, the box titled 'Current Date and Time' will show something like '2018/06/30 12:55:44'. Look closely to see if it is correct. If it is wrong, edit to the correct time and date then press enter."

            "question": "How do I connect to the SparqLinq Wi-Fi AP (Access Point) after connecting it to the customer’s Wi-Fi?",
            "answer": "One option is to have them connect to their router and look under the active devices to see the IP address the router assigned the SparqLinq. If you need to disconnect the SparqLinq from the customer’s Wi-Fi, use a paperclip to push the reset button on the side of the SparqLinq. This will reset the Wi-Fi mode in the SparqLinq so it will open an AP (Access Point) with these credentials:\n\nSSID: SparqLinq\nPWD: 'SparqLinq 80211'\n\nOn a Wi-Fi enabled laptop or phone, connect to this Wi-Fi AP and go to the dashboard by typing in the address http://192.168.111.1/"

            "question": "My SparqLinq is joined to most Quad 1200’s but some are distant and not connecting. What can I do?",
            "answer": "Plug the SparqLinq into an extension cord and move it to different locations (possibly outside or up on the roof) and try joining to the inverter using the 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab. It is important that the Quad 1200 be first joined to the SparqLinq before it can start connecting to other inverters in a mesh network. Put the SparqLinq in a non-metallic weatherproof box on the roof to get it closer to the inverters. It may be necessary to use a second SparqLinq to connect the additional inverters. If the inverters have been joined to the first SparqLinq, you will need to go to its 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab and click on the 'X' in the Release column before the Quad 1200’s can be joined to a new SparqLinq. Two or more SparqLinqs can be monitored on the SparqVu website, but there is no function to allow pairing the sites together."

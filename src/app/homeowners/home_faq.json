                    "answer": "Solar PV systems are generally low maintenance, but upkeep depends on the system type and the long-term reliability of its components. Panels may require occasional cleaning to remove dirt, dust, or debris, especially in dry or dusty areas. An annual inspection is recommended to check for issues with wiring, mounting hardware, or performance drops. One of the most common maintenance concerns involves the failure of electrolytic capacitors—key components in inverters—which typically have a lifespan of 10-12 years, depending on heat, usage, and environmental conditions. Choosing high-quality inverters and components can help minimize long-term maintenance needs and improve overall system reliability."

                    "answer": "In the SPARQ User App, carbon intensity is used to calculate the reduction in CO2 emissions due to your solar plant. By producing your own solar energy, you reduce the need for electricity from the grid, thus lowering overall CO2 emissions. To accurately calculate this reduction, the app requires you to input the carbon intensity value for your region."

By producing solar energy, you reduce the amount of electricity you need to purchase from the grid, directly lowering your electricity bill. To provide an accurate calculation, the app requires you to input your electricity unit price."

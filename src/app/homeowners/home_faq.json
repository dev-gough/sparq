Panels may require occasional cleaning to remove dirt, dust, or debris, especially in dry or dusty areas. An annual inspection is recommended to check for issues with wiring, mounting hardware, or performance drops. One of the most common maintenance concerns involves the failure of electrolytic capacitors—key components in inverters—which typically have a lifespan of 10-12 years, depending on heat, usage, and environmental conditions. Choosing high-quality inverters and components can help minimize long-term maintenance needs and improve overall system reliability."

It is important that the microinverter be first joined to the SparqLinq before it can start connecting to other inverters in a mesh network. Put the SparqLinq in a non-metallic weatherproof box on the roof to get it closer to the inverters. It may be necessary to use a second SparqLinq to connect the additional inverters. If the inverters have been joined to the first SparqLinq, you will need to go to its 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab and click on the 'X' in the Release column before the microinverters can be joined to a new SparqLinq. Two or more SparqLinqs can be monitored on the SparqVu website, but there is no function to allow pairing the sites together."

                    "question": "What is Carbon Intensity of Electricity Generation?",
                    "answer": "Carbon intensity refers to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced per unit of electricity generated. It is typically measured in grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (g CO2/kWh). The carbon intensity can vary depending on the energy mix used by your local electricity grid (e.g., coal, natural gas, nuclear, or renewable energy sources like wind or solar)."

                    "question": "Why is it important?",
                    "answer": "In the SPARQ User App, carbon intensity is used to calculate the reduction in CO2 emissions due to your solar plant. By producing your own solar energy, you reduce the need for electricity from the grid, thus lowering overall CO2 emissions. To accurately calculate this reduction, the app requires you to input the carbon intensity value for your region."

                    "question": "What is Electricity Unit Price?",
                    "answer": "Electricity unit price refers to the cost you pay per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity consumed from the grid. This price can vary based on your electricity provider, the time of day, and the type of plan you're on (e.g., fixed, variable, or time-of-use pricing)."

                    "answer": "The electricity unit price is used to calculate the amount of money you save by generating your own solar energy. By producing solar energy, you reduce the amount of electricity you need to purchase from the grid, directly lowering your electricity bill. To provide an accurate calculation, the app requires you to input your electricity unit price."

                    "answer": "You can find your electricity unit price on your electricity bill, usually listed as the cost per kWh. If you have multiple rates (e.g., peak and off-peak), you may input an average value."

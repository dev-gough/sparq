                    "answer": "SparqLinq missing data may occur if the time and date was not restored correctly from an internet time server when the SparqLinq was last power cycled. This causes the data to be stored under the default date set in the SparqLinq, instead of under today’s date. To check this, go to the 'Settings->Installation Information' page. At the bottom of the tab, the box titled 'Current Date and Time' will show something like '2018/06/30 12:55:44'. Look closely to see if it is correct. If it is wrong, edit to the correct time and date then press enter."

                    "answer": "One option is to have them connect to their router and look under the active devices to see the IP address the router assigned the SparqLinq. If you need to disconnect the SparqLinq from the customer’s Wi-Fi, use a paperclip to push the reset button on the side of the SparqLinq. This will reset the Wi-Fi mode in the SparqLinq so it will open an AP (Access Point) with these credentials:\n\nSSID: SparqLinq\nPWD: 'SparqLinq 80211'\n\nOn a Wi-Fi enabled laptop or phone, connect to this Wi-Fi AP and go to the dashboard by typing in the address http://192.168.111.1/"

                    "question": "My SparqLinq is joined to most Quad 1200’s but some are distant and not connecting. What can I do?",
                    "answer": "Plug the SparqLinq into an extension cord and move it to different locations (possibly outside or up on the roof) and try joining to the inverter using the 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab. It is important that the Quad 1200 be first joined to the SparqLinq before it can start connecting to other inverters in a mesh network. Put the SparqLinq in a non-metallic weatherproof box on the roof to get it closer to the inverters. It may be necessary to use a second SparqLinq to connect the additional inverters. If the inverters have been joined to the first SparqLinq, you will need to go to its 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab and click on the 'X' in the Release column before the Quad 1200’s can be joined to a new SparqLinq. Two or more SparqLinqs can be monitored on the SparqVu website, but there is no function to allow pairing the sites together."

                    "question": "What is Carbon Intensity of Electricity Generation?",
                    "answer": "Carbon intensity refers to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced per unit of electricity generated. It is typically measured in grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (g CO2/kWh). The carbon intensity can vary depending on the energy mix used by your local electricity grid (e.g., coal, natural gas, nuclear, or renewable energy sources like wind or solar)."

                    "question": "Why is it important?",
                    "answer": "In the SPARQ User App, carbon intensity is used to calculate the reduction in CO2 emissions due to your solar plant. By producing your own solar energy, you reduce the need for electricity from the grid, thus lowering overall CO2 emissions. To accurately calculate this reduction, the app requires you to input the carbon intensity value for your region."

                    "question": "What is Electricity Unit Price?",
                    "answer": "Electricity unit price refers to the cost you pay per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity consumed from the grid. This price can vary based on your electricity provider, the time of day, and the type of plan you’re on (e.g., fixed, variable, or time-of-use pricing)."

                    "answer": "The electricity unit price is used to calculate the amount of money you save by generating your own solar energy. By producing solar energy, you reduce the amount of electricity you need to purchase from the grid, directly lowering your electricity bill. To provide an accurate calculation, the app requires you to input your electricity unit price."

                    "answer": "You can find your electricity unit price on your electricity bill, usually listed as the cost per kWh. If you have multiple rates (e.g., peak and off-peak), you may input an average value."

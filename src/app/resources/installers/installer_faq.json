                    "answer": "The Q2000 microinverter has 4 independent inputs that are transformer isolated from the AC output and have their negative DC inputs referenced to ground thru the GFDI circuit. Considering the inverter handles each module individually, the calculations are below for the 64-200 (1):\n\n• the rated operating current and voltage; this is the module maximum power current (Imp) and module maximum power voltage (Vmp).\n\n• the maximum photovoltaic source circuit voltage; this is equal to the PV module’s open circuit voltage (Voc).\n\n• the rated short-circuit current; this is equal to the PV module’s short circuit current (Isc).\n\nThe Trunk cable used with the Q2000 connects the AC output of all inverters in parallel. This means the voltage on the trunk cable remains the same (240Vac) but the current from each inverter (7.5 Amps) gets added. A trunk with 3 inverters connected to it will have 2 x 7.5A = 22.5A under full power. Adding a 1.25 safety factor gives a design current of 22.5 x 1.25 = 28.125A."

                    "answer": "The status LED on the Q2000 will be flashing green when working correctly. If the LED is flashing Red, this indicates an AC issue so check the AC breaker. If the LED is amber, this indicates a ground fault was detected so check for faulty DC wiring then connect to the SparqLinq and go to the 'Settings->Inverter Management' page and click the Clear GFDI (blue lightning bolt) icon."

                    "answer": "The Q2000 microinverter has 4 independent inputs that are transformer isolated from the AC output and have their negative DC inputs referenced to ground thru the GFDI circuit. Considering the inverter handles each module individually, the calculations are below for the 64-200 (1):\n\n• the rated operating current and voltage; this is the module maximum power current (Imp) and module maximum power voltage (Vmp).\n\n• the maximum photovoltaic source circuit voltage; this is equal to the PV module’s open circuit voltage (Voc).\n\n• the rated short-circuit current; this is equal to the PV module’s short circuit current (Isc).\n\nThe Trunk cable used with the Q2000 connects the AC output of all inverters in parallel. This means the voltage on the trunk cable remains the same (240Vac) but the current from each inverter (7.5 Amps) gets added. A trunk with 3 inverters connected to it will have 2 x 7.5A = 22.5A under full power. Adding a 1.25 safety factor gives a design current of 22.5 x 1.25 = 28.125A."

This causes the data to be stored under the default date set in the SparqLinq, instead of under today’s date. To check this, go to the 'Settings->Installation Information' page. At the bottom of the tab, the box titled 'Current Date and Time' will show something like '2018/06/30 12:55:44'. Look closely to see if it is correct.

                  "answer": "One option is to have them connect to their router and look under the active devices to see the IP address the router assigned the SparqLinq. If you need to disconnect the SparqLinq from the customer’s Wi-Fi, use a paperclip to push the reset button on the side of the SparqLinq. This will reset the Wi-Fi mode in the SparqLinq so it will open an AP (Access Point) with these credentials:\n\nSSID: SparqLinq\nPWD: 'SparqLinq 80211'\n\nOn a Wi-Fi enabled laptop or phone, connect to this Wi-Fi AP and go to the dashboard by typing in the address http://192.168.111.1/"

                  "answer": "Plug the SparqLinq into an extension cord and move it to different locations (possibly outside or up on the roof) and try joining to the inverter using the 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab. It is important that the Quad 1200 be first joined to the SparqLinq before it can start connecting to other inverters in a mesh network. Put the SparqLinq in a non-metallic weatherproof box on the roof to get it closer to the inverters. It may be necessary to use a second SparqLinq to connect the additional inverters. If the inverters have been joined to the first SparqLinq, you will need to go to its 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab and click on the 'X' in the Release column before the Quad 1200’s can be joined to a new SparqLinq. Two or more SparqLinqs can be monitored on the SparqVu website, but there is no function to allow pairing the sites together."

It is typically measured in grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (g CO2/kWh). The carbon intensity can vary depending on the energy mix used by your local electricity grid (e.g., coal, natural gas, nuclear, or renewable energy sources like wind or solar)."

                    "question": "Why is it important?",
                    "answer": "In the SPARQ User App, carbon intensity is used to calculate the reduction in CO2 emissions due to your solar plant. By producing your own solar energy, you reduce the need for electricity from the grid, thus lowering overall CO2 emissions. To accurately calculate this reduction, the app requires you to input the carbon intensity value for your region."

By producing solar energy, you reduce the amount of electricity you need to purchase from the grid, directly lowering your electricity bill. To provide an accurate calculation, the app requires you to input your electricity unit price."

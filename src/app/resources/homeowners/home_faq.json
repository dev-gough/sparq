                    "question": "How can I tell if the Q2000 inverter is working?",
                    "answer": "The status LED on the Q2000 will be flashing green when working correctly. If the LED is flashing Red, this indicates an AC issue so check the AC breaker. If the LED is amber, this indicates a ground fault was detected so check for faulty DC wiring then connect to the SparqLinq and go to the 'Settings->Inverter Management' page and click the Clear GFDI (blue lightning bolt) icon."

If you need to disconnect the SparqLinq from the customer’s Wi-Fi, use a paperclip to push the reset button on the side of the SparqLinq. This will reset the Wi-Fi mode in the SparqLinq so it will open an AP (Access Point) with these credentials:\n\nSSID: SparqLinq\nPWD: 'SparqLinq 80211'\n\nOn a Wi-Fi enabled laptop or phone, connect to this Wi-Fi AP and go to the dashboard by typing in the address http://192.168.111.1/"

                    "answer": "Plug the SparqLinq into an extension cord and move it to different locations (possibly outside or up on the roof) and try joining to the inverter using the 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab. It is important that the Quad 1200 be first joined to the SparqLinq before it can start connecting to other inverters in a mesh network. Put the SparqLinq in a non-metallic weatherproof box on the roof to get it closer to the inverters. It may be necessary to use a second SparqLinq to connect the additional inverters. If the inverters have been joined to the first SparqLinq, you will need to go to its 'Settings-Inverter Management' tab and click on the 'X' in the Release column before the Quad 1200’s can be joined to a new SparqLinq. Two or more SparqLinqs can be monitored on the SparqVu website, but there is no function to allow pairing the sites together."

                    "answer": "In the SPARQ User App, carbon intensity is used to calculate the reduction in CO2 emissions due to your solar plant. By producing your own solar energy, you reduce the need for electricity from the grid, thus lowering overall CO2 emissions. To accurately calculate this reduction, the app requires you to input the carbon intensity value for your region."

                    "answer": "Electricity unit price refers to the cost you pay per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity consumed from the grid. This price can vary based on your electricity provider, the time of day, and the type of plan you’re on (e.g., fixed, variable, or time-of-use pricing)."

By producing solar energy, you reduce the amount of electricity you need to purchase from the grid, directly lowering your electricity bill. To provide an accurate calculation, the app requires you to input your electricity unit price."

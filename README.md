This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the required packages (ensure you're in the main dir):

```bash
npm install
```

You'll need an API key from Finhub set in a .env.local file (you'll need to create this file)

You can either get ask me for one or generate your own here: [https://finnhub.io/register](https://finnhub.io/register)

```text
FINNHUB_API_KEY={your API key here}
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
